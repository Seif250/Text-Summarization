# Text Summarization Project ✍️📖

A deep learning-based project for summarizing articles into concise highlights. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and attention mechanisms to extract meaningful summaries from long text articles.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📄 Clean and preprocess text data for NLP tasks.
- 🖼 Visualize data insights with histograms and word clouds.
- 🔠 Tokenize and pad sequences for training deep learning models.
- 🧠 Build and train a sequence-to-sequence model with attention for text summarization.
- 💾 Save trained models and tokenizers for future use.

---

## 📚 Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - 🔹 `pandas`, `numpy`: For data processing and numerical computations.
  - 🔹 `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`: For data visualization.
  - 🔹 `tensorflow.keras`: For building and training the deep learning model.
  - 🔹 `sklearn`: For splitting datasets into training and testing sets.

## 🔄 How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd text_summarization_project
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn wordcloud tensorflow scikit-learn
   ```
3. Place your dataset (`train.csv`) in the root directory. Ensure it has the required columns:
   - `article`
   - `highlights`
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧪 Workflow
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and standardize text by removing special characters, numbers, and extra spaces.
   - Tokenize and pad the sequences for both articles and highlights.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Generate histograms for article and summary lengths.
   - Create word clouds to highlight frequently used terms.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Use LSTM and attention mechanisms to develop a seq2seq model for summarization.
   - Optimize model performance with callbacks like `EarlyStopping` and `ReduceLROnPlateau`.
4. **Saving Artifacts**:
   - Save the trained model and tokenizers for future inference.
